## Our Community

**We engineers, mathematicians, system designers, we shape paradigms and the path of humanity**, we’ve been doing it for millennia; yet it is the first time in history that our ability to create technology is more powerful than money or influence, and therefore we must collaborate together.

**We want to be excited about our work**, by making common the usage of more advanced and interesting technologies, through sharing knowledge, training our peers and influencing the industry.

**We have the chance to solve more significant and exciting problems**, by giving contracting services, supporting the open source software community and social impact projects.
