<li>Software Libraries</li>
<li>Apprenticeship Program</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Trainings"><a href="#Trainings" class="headerlink" title="Trainings"></a>Trainings</h2><p>We give free training to the greater public and to ourselves. At this point, to the greater public we do it through meetups, twitch.tv stream trainings, and videos in youtube. We also have an apprenticeship program, where we personally tutorship individuals, and also serves as a method for recruiting to our community.</p>
<h2 id="Development-of-Kratia"><a href="#Development-of-Kratia" class="headerlink" title="Development of Kratia"></a>Development of Kratia</h2><p>The nascent distributed communities and organizations around the globe deserve a tool to help them perform, grow and succeed. </p>
<p>The success of small and big communities alike is mainly determined by their ability to make decisions in collaboration. Kratia provides the blocks required to design, build and evolve successful digital governance, by offering conceptual and digital tools that enable any type of community to make decisions and automate on top of them. </p>
<p>Kratia is Lambda One current main project, and we would like to use it to empower our own community as well.</p>
<h2 id="Consulting"><a href="#Consulting" class="headerlink" title="Consulting"></a>Consulting</h2><p>Lambda One accumulates knowledge and skill, and it offers these to other organizations in the form of consulting. May it be with the purpose of supporting a project that is aligned with our values, or with the purpose of generating resource income to Lambda One.</p>
<h2 id="Development-of-Software-Libraries"><a href="#Development-of-Software-Libraries" class="headerlink" title="Development of Software Libraries"></a>Development of Software Libraries</h2><p>One of our objectives is to make the correct development of systems as easy as possible, that is why the development of libraries that achieve such objectives comes naturally as part of our activities.</p>
<h3 id="scala-intuition"><a href="#scala-intuition" class="headerlink" title="scala-intuition"></a>scala-intuition</h3><p>A simple library for composable assertions. Uses a DSL made with recursion schemes to express complex truths about a system, helping massively with the creation of testing software.</p>
<h3 id="scala-dsl-toolbox"><a href="#scala-dsl-toolbox" class="headerlink" title="scala-dsl-toolbox"></a>scala-dsl-toolbox</h3><p>A collection of tagless final ALgebras, interpreters and their laws for all kind of domains. It is a big toolbox that helps you write with ease the domain logic of your programs without sacrificing correctness or reinventing the wheel on common domains like persistence, or communication. </p>
<h2 id="Apprenticeship-Program"><a href="#Apprenticeship-Program" class="headerlink" title="Apprenticeship Program"></a>Apprenticeship Program</h2><p>Every Tuesday we gather to develop Lambda One software libraries and the source code of Kratia, this together with the tutorship offered, creates the opportunity to access a purely functional, high quality project, with personal guidance; effectively providing an exceptional learning experience.</p>
<p>As well every participating apprentice has access to an open communication channel with their tutor and the apprenticeship community, giving the opportunity to make questions any day, at any time, using the provided software.</p>
<p>Lambda One will also provide a list of fundamental skills and concepts that every apprentice should master through the program, and also a method to validate and test such acquired skills at any given moment. Once a participating apprentice has achieved to complete and master the list of skills and concepts, the apprentice may choose to take the next benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>A personal recommendation and help on finding a job related to the skills acquired.</li>
<li>An invitation to form part of Lambda One as a journeyman, and take an important role on our exciting projects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Requirements"><a href="#Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Requirements"></a>Requirements</h3><p>Participate at least on 2 events per month, and a constant interaction through the communication tools. A notisable effort on studying and practicing.</p>
<h3 id="After-the-Program"><a href="#After-the-Program" class="headerlink" title="After the Program"></a>After the Program</h3><p>As an apprentice you are free to use your knowledge according to your own free will, but if you decide to be part of an active effort to create a fair, rich and exciting future for everyone, after the apprentice program you will be invited to be a full member, one who shares the core values, and one who uses the acquired elite skills on impactful projects. Be prepared to live a life full of purpose, thirsty of knowledge, and hungry for challenges.</p>
